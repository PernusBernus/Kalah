1. Overview of the program
--------------------------
The purpose of the program is to create the board game kalah. We have decided to implement this using the Java programming language.

//Game Structure

The kalah program is made up of a player class, main method and A.I class.

The player class is used to represent the 2 players, it has 3 data fields which consist of a Boolean named 'turn' which determines the turn of a player , an integer for 'chosen' position and an integer for 'target' position on the board. The constructor initializes the data fields, 'turn' is set to false 'chosen' and 'target' are set to 0. There are get and set methods for each data field.

The main class deals with the core game, it has 4 data fields, a Boolean named 'gameover' which controls when the game finishes, an integer array named 'board' which holds the houses and stores and 2 integer data fields named 'beanSumP1' and 'beanSumP2' which counts the number of beans in the houses of each respective player. Boolean 'gameover' is inittially set to false, the 'board' array consists of 14 elements, 12 for the houses and 2 for each players store. The sum of the players houses are set to 0, a loop is used to go through the array filling each house with 4 and leaving the stores empty.

//The turn for player 1 and player 2 occur in a loop, turn will be set to true
//chosen gets set to persons choice
//If the chosen is more then 5 or less than 0 or empty error produced invalid house chosen reset to 0
//valid move target set to chosen + number of beans and plays move
//checks for if all houses are empty if true then gameover is not then 


//How players make decisions

The A.I class deals with how players make decisions in the game. We have implemented a minimax algorithm with alpha beta pruning. The class finds the possible moves available and deducts the best move. We have a utility function determined by the difference of each stores at the end of each possible move
